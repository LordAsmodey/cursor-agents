# Design Command

When the user says **design** or **design: &lt;feature description&gt;** (or an equivalent request to create a UI/UX design for a feature):

1. **Apply** the skill **design-feature** from `.cursor/skills/design-feature/SKILL.md`.
2. **Execute** the full workflow as **Design Orchestrator** (management only — you do not create HTML/CSS yourself):
   - Parse input: feature name, description, optional reference URL / competitor site / style notes.
   - Define output folder: `designs/<feature-slug>/`.
   - Call **designer** (mcp_task, subagent_type: designer) to create HTML+CSS in that folder.
   - Call **design-reviewer** (mcp_task, subagent_type: design-reviewer) to check requirements, responsiveness, accessibility.
   - On FAILED review: pass issues back to designer and repeat (max 3 rework cycles); then circuit breaker if still FAILED.
   - Report to the user: path to the folder and how to use it with implement ("implement: <feature> — design is ready in `designs/<feature-slug>/`").

Input can be a text description, reference URL, competitor site, or similar — **Figma or ready mockups are not required**.

Do not skip the design-reviewer step or the rework/circuit breaker rules.
